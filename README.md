Price Tracking Application 

This is an experimental Kotlin Android project. Due to some server side problems, the project is not in production now but it's ready to ship. I'm still doing refactor on code and trying to improve Kotlin spesific implementations in project. 

Code reviews and PRs are always approvable. 

Feel free to modify and use code.
